# Model-Deployment-using-Github-Iris-Dataset

**Problem Statement**
You are working within an organisation as a data scientist. You are responsible for training and 
deploying the models that you create. As is often the case you are a part of the team that work 
towards the same goals. This creates a need to be able to collaborate with each other within the team 
and organisation.
For best practice, the organization uses github to keep track of everyone’s code. Since your models are 
to be consumed within different teams, the organization insists that you wrap your models in a flask 
server and containerize the same. To share this docker image with others, the company also expects 
everyone to push their docker image to dockerhub. This makes sharing docker images with each other 
very easy and leads to better compatibility and collaboration within the organization as everyone can 
use each other’s code and resources without hassle thereby driving productivity across the 
organization. So, not only are you expected to train your ML models, you are also expected to make it 
available and easily accessible organisation wide.
Since, wrapping your model inside a flask server, containerizing and sharing the same is a day to day 
activity. It is expected of you to automate the same. Using CI/CD pipelines, github actions are 
recommended.
